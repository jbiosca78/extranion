# Extranion

This is a retro shoot 'em up game inspired by MSX Exerion.

The game is a simple 2D game where the player controls a spaceship and shoots down enemy spaceships.

The mechanics are simple, kill all of them!
You gain points and charge by killing enemies. Charge can be used for rapid fire. Dont waste it!
