In the year 2044, Elon Musk finally sent a spacecraft to Mars.
But there was life. And that life was not happy. The Martians
emerged from their hideouts and prepared to attack our planet!
The only hope for us is the new ship that SpaceX are building,
controlled remotely with Neuralink technology. You are a pilot
of these ships. You must destroy them before they reach Earth.
You must do a good job killing martians or Elon will fire you!
